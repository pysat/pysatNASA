"""Template for a pysat.Instrument support file that utilizes CDAWeb methods.

Copy and modify this file as needed when adding a new Instrument to pysat.

This is a good area to introduce the instrument, provide background
on the mission, operations, instrumenation, and measurements.

Also a good place to provide contact information. This text will
be included in the pysat API documentation.

Properties
----------
platform
    *List platform string here*
name
    *List name string here*
inst_id
    *List supported inst_ids here*
tag
    *List supported tag strings here*

Note
----
- Optional section, remove if no notes

Warnings
--------
- Optional section, remove if no warnings
- Two blank lines needed afterward for proper formatting


Examples

    - 'dirty'
        There are data areas that have issues, data should be used with caution
